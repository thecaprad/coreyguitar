                <p>I grew up in Illinois, born in the year of the Gameboy. My favorite things to do have always been playing with computers and guitars.</p>
                <p>I was lucky to attend a public high school that had a wonderful arts program. I did everything from writing music for school plays, playing drums in the marching band, being in the pit for plenty of musicals, and being a part of a (<a href="https://youtu.be/LqyU6Sg3X5s" target="_blank">now viral</a>) silly talent show performance of the Halo theme song. </p>

                <p>
                    I completed a BFA in jazz guitar performance at the Univertsity of Michigan. While there, I explored my desire to play guitar in musical theatre pit orchestras. UM has a fantastic musical theatre department, and I was in every show or cabaret that would have me.

                    In 2012 after college graduation, I moved to Los Angeles for a job with an iPad-based sheet music startup called Chromatik. It was the early days of sheet music on tablets. I worked in QA, marketing, and ultimately ran our sheet music production team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time, my college band had gone viral on Reddit for our cover of the soul classic “Sunny.” From that attention, we successfully funded and completed our self-titled EP, Ann Street Soul.

                    After a year in LA, I decided to move to Chicago where there is a much larger musical theatre scene/market. (And for my wife and I to be closer to our families!) I continued working for Chromatik remotely for a few years longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After years of playing shows in small houses (and high schools!) I broke into the Union scene, and I’ve  been lucky to be a part of some wonderful productions. A highlight to date was being a regular sub in the Chicago production of Hamilton. (For lead guitarist <a href="https://feltonoffard.com/bio" target="_blank">Felton Offard</a>.)

                <p>In 2015 I left Chromatik to join Soundslice as the content director.</p>
                <p>
                    If you haven’t seen it, Soundslice is a web-based platform that lets you sync sheet music with real recordings. It’s an incredible tool for self study and teaching — it is used by some big organizations including TrueFire, Premiere Guitar and the Berklee School of Music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I work directly with so many artists via Soundslice, I occasionally am mistakenly called the founder of the company, which is not true! Soundslice was by founded by Adrian Holovaty and PJ Macklin. You can call me employee #3, though I am a proud co-owner.

                    I still work at Soundslice and have been growing in my web development chops. I’m quite comfortable with Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript and PostgreSQL.

                <p>
                    You can usually find me at the Irish music session on Tuesday nights at the Galway Arms in Chicago.
