                <p>This song was written by LA friends Kim Tilman and Chris Lorentz who go by the collective name Tragic Gadget. As they wrote this song, I dropped by their recording space in Hollywood and was asked to record layer upon layer of different ideas.</p>

                <p>I love what they ultimately selected, cut up and processed. The guitar parts sound to me like a child between a Katy Perry and Jackson Five song — good things in my book.</p>
                
                <p>The animation was done by a group of San Francisco-based creators, Abraham Dieckman, Timothy Hahn and Pamela Goodman. (Chinese Takeout Animation)</p>

                <p class="credit">Guitarist, producer and writer</p>
                <p>In the summer of 2013, myself and friends from college put together this EP.</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="{% static 'website/images/work-blog/duderstadt-phone.jpg' %}">

                </figure>

                <p>About a year before this release, a video recording we made in my living room went viral on break.com and reddit.com/r/videos (See the next work example, “Sunny.”) We weren’t planning to be “a band,” but overnight we had fans from all over the world.</p>

                <p>The timing was not great, as many of us were moving to different parts of the US following graduation. We decided to strike while the iron was hot, and launched a successful Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/annstreetsoul/ann-street-soul-ep" target="_blank">campaign</a> to fund the creation of this EP, and really, the band.</p>
                                
                <p>The putting together of the EP was a huge process, especially for a band that didn’t all live in the same place. We recorded the tunes between studios in North Hollywood, CA and Ann Arbor, MI.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="{% static 'website/images/work-blog/hollywood-horns.jpg' %}">

                </figure>
                
                <p>This was the final track from the EP and the last we wrote for it. It came about while we recorded all the rhythm section parts in Ann Arbor, which was the first part of the recording process. Those rhythm tracks were recorded live, and they served as the bedrock for all the vocals, horns and later orchestration. One of the tunes was just not working, and we knew we needed one more song. We wrote this on a coffee-fueled night before our final day of studio time.</p>
                
                <p>Most people who have anything nice to tell me about this EP usually say that this is their favorite song. Go figure?</p>

                <p>The band didn’t stick together in the end, but I’m proud of what we all put together. You can check out the whole EP <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1i0L5IKI2xLdOCwQHRokKQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
