<h1>Musician’s blog</h1>

<p><img src="{% static 'website/images/work-blog/frank-homepage.png' %}" alt="Website screenshot"></p>

<p>I built this website for jazz guitarist Frank Portolese — you can view it live at <a href="https://www.frankportolese.com" target="blank">www.frankportolese.com</a>. It features a blog and gig calendar which are managed by the artist himself using simple admin tools. It uses Python/Django on the backend, and HTML and Bootstrap on the frontend. You can view the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/thecaprad/frankportolese" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Frank is a dear friend, mentor and kick-ass guitar player(!)</p>
