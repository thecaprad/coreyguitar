<p>The summer after my sophomore year of college, I played guitar for an original musical being put together by a group of students that called themselves <a href="https://www.teamstarkid.com/" target="_blank">Team Starkid</a>. The previous school year, they had made a parody show all about Harry Potter, <i><a href="https://youtu.be/wmwM_AKeMCk" target="_blank">A Very Potter Musical</a></i>. Basically: What if Harry Potter was a bit more crass, and had some really good original songs? (The songs were really good.)</p>
<p>They filmed the show in a black box theatre on campus, and once they put it online, the Harry Potter fan website pottermore.com blasted it into virality.</p>
<p>So when they decided to make a sequel, we all kind of knew it would be a similar success, and it was. The creative team started putting together the material and rehearsing when the semester ended. It really was a mad-dash to the finish.</p>
<p>We ran it for I think two weeks. There were lines out the theatre door — people were traveling from far across the country to see it. It was wild.</p>
<p>The recording quality is definitely dated, and we didn't have any good microphones or anything. (The cast just needed to be loud and the band needed to be less loud.) It was a great time and a very happy memory. Fans of the TV show <i>Glee</i>, <i>Versace</i> and <i>American Horror Story</i> will recognize the star as Darren Criss. (This was pre-fame, of course!)</p>
