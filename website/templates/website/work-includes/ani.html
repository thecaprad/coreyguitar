        <p>This is a solo guitar piece by Julian Lage from his <em>World’s Fair</em> album.</p>

        <p>I spent a long time working on it. There are some serious picking and dynamic challenges that were tough for me to learn, and tougher for my neighbors to listen to.</p>
            
        <p>I hope you enjoy.</p>
