# coreyguitar.com — personal website

This website was created as a portfolio to showcase my work as a web developer and professional musician.

This website was built with Python/Django on the backend and plain ‘ol HTML, CSS and Javascript on the frontend. With some resizing, you’ll notice that the design is responsive, and was built with a mobile-first mentality.

I created this website as a final project for an intensive [web development course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design) offered by Coursera/The University of Michigan. 

Below you'll 'find a video where I walk the through some of the thinking behind my approaches/solutions. Though it’s rudimentary, hopefully you’ll see that I took care to incorporate proper semantics and accessibility standards.
